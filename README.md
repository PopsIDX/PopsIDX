## 👺 Who Am I ?
Hello there! 👋 My name is **Etienne**, also known as **Pops**, and I'm a 26-year-old **Web Developer** 👨‍💻 based in **Lyon, France** 🦁. Currently, I work as a **Video Developer 📹** at **Bedrock Streaming** through my consulting work at **Zenika** 🔴.

I'm deeply passionate about exploring new technologies and pushing the boundaries of what's possible on the web 🌐. I'm particularly interested in the fascinating worlds of virtual and augmented reality 🤖👓, and I'm currently expanding my skills by learning WebGL and ThreeJS to create immersive 3D 🎲 experiences for my projects.

When I'm not coding, I love spending time with animals 🐶🐱 and hope to have some of my own one day 🥰. I'm also an avid gamer 🎮, and I use my free time to complete games to 100% to add to my platinum trophy collection 🏆.
